# ProjectMovie

ProjectMovie is a Flutter application designed to help users discover and explore movies. This project serves as a foundation for building feature-rich movie apps using Flutter.

> **Note:** If you are using a Jio network, the TMDB API may not work and movies may not load. Please use a VPN to access the app. A proxy server will be added in the future to remove the need for a VPN.
